## Rea Garvey

In June of 2011, I had the great opportunity to journey to the heart of the Ecuadorian Amazon, where I met Donald Moncayo. Donald is a father and a son and a husband. He lost his own mother due to cancer and he, as well, suffers from respiratory problems. Donald knows that his own wife and daughter will, sooner or later, be victims of the contamination.
